# Sogeti Training Camp App
This app is a cross-platform app to be used on both Android and iOS devices. Created using the React Native framework.  

Refer to [React Native's Getting Started page](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for initial setup.  
For development, I use [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and followed [this guide](https://www.undefinednull.com/2016/04/21/debugging-react-native-apps-using-visual-studio-code/) for my React Native development environment.

Current required packages:
* react-native-lock
* react-native-drawer

**Setting up the project on your machine locally**  
1. `git init`  
2. `git clone https://github.com/wspringe/SogetiTrainingCampApp.git`  
3. `cd SogetiTrainingCampApp`  
4. `npm install`  
5.  To run on ios: `react-native run-ios`  
6.  To run on android: `react-native run-android`  

**Testing:**  
1. Signup for a new account and create an email and password.  
2. Afterwards, login with the email and password that was registered.
